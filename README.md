# crypto_evaluator


In this project I took a CSV file with data on over 1100 cryptocurrencies.  I am looking to create data to determine whether or not crypto currencies can be clustered together or not.  I will be utilizing Unsupervised Machine Learning using StandardScaler to standardize the data and TSNE and k-means to conduct analysis.
